### Usage issues

#### How should I import a component properly?

Currently, as the library does not support tree-shaking, the recommended way to `import` a component
is using the entry file of the component, and **not** importing from the index file:

```js
import Button from 'wix-style-react/Button';
```

`import`ing a component directly from `dist/src` is strongly disencouraged.

#### My PR was merged, why can't I see it in my project?

You PR might've merged into the `master` branch, but a new version containing it was not released
yet. You can contact the WSR team (on Slack) to request a release.

#### Why am I getting a weired error when using some component's TestKit?

##### `TypeError: document.x is not a function`

You might need to include a Polyfill in your test file. We provide some [essential
polyfills](../../testkit/polyfills/index.js), you may use them in the following way:

```js
import { rangePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/dist/testkit/polyfills';

beforeEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.install();
});

afterEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.uninstall();
});

// ...
```

Check out the documentation of the component you're using for more info.

#### How can I get colors and fonts to use in my project?

We recommend using the [Typography
components](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=1.%20Foundation&selectedStory=1.2%20Typography&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0)
in order to get the right colors and fonts. Alternatively, if these components does not suit your
needs, you can use the [Typography
classes](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Styling&selectedStory=1.2%20Typography%20Classes&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0)
instead.

Also check out the
[`<Box/>`](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Components&selectedStory=Box&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0)
component for using correct colors and fonts.

### Contributing issues

#### Created a PR but the build is failing on CI, should I do something?

You should investigate the failing build and fix it. Sometimes, your build might be failing because
of a flaky test, so re-running it may solve the issue.

#### How can I run only one test locally?

For component tests (file ending with `.spec.js`) we're using jest. You can add a `.only` flag to
your `it` / `describe` in order to make it focused, but you'll need to run only the file containing
the test. You can start watch mode by running `$ npm run test:watch`, then pressing `p` in order to
filter your specific test file.

For e2e tests we're using `protractor`, which uses `jasmine` under the hood. You can make an `it` or
`describe` block focused by prefixing it with a `f`, so `it` will turn to `fit` and `describe` will
turn to `fdescribe`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure to not push focused tests. Your build will fail when you do.**

#### I have a request for a feature or a new component. How can I get it?

Simply [open a new issue!](https://github.com/wix-private/wsr-issues/issues/new) Even better, you
can also open a PR is you'd like! We'll love to accept new contributions  üòÑ.
